# The-Cursor-s-Curse
This is an incomplete game I created using pygame that involves sound effects, music, animations, buttons, and much more.

The idea of this game is that a cursor is cursed with never-ending bullets shooting down on it.

I have enjoyed the process of creating this game because I was able to discover the connections between understanding math to write code that works well. An example in this game is the health bar, for example. I had to have two layers and substracting a portion of the bar until it reaches 0 (death). 

Furthermore, I enjoyed the process of designing sprites and a background all on my own despite it being far from perfect.
